How to build for Linux
======================

First you need to configure:

$ ./configure

If any dependencies are missing the configure script will complain.
You then have the option to disable that particular module/subsystem.

$ make

Build the binary, after build the binary resides in 'build.linux/'.
Thus, to start it, just type:

$ build.linux/showtime


How to build for Mac OS X
=========================

Install Xcode (http://developer.apple.com/Tools/) which includes Xcode IDE,
gcc toolchain and much more. iPhone SDK also includes Xcode and toolchain.

Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)

Install freetype via MacPorts:

$ sudo /opt/local/bin/port install freetype (see note below if you want to
build with 10.4 support).

Now run configure

$ ./configure

If configured successfully, build the binary

$ make

Run showtime binary from build directory

$ build.osx/Showtime.app/Contents/MacOS/showtime

Run showtime app from build directory

$ open build.osx/Showtime.app

Optionally you can build Showtime.dmg disk image. Note that you should probably
run configure with --release to embed theme files or else the binary will
include paths your local build tree.

$ make Showtime.dmg

To build with 10.4 (Tiger) support, remember to build freetype with 10.4
support (hint: macports.conf: sysroot=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk). 10.4
SDK is included as an optional package for Xcode.

$ ./configure --macosxtarget=10.4 --macosxsdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

To build with 10.4 (tiger) support for PPC

$ ./configure --arch=powerpc --cc=powerpc-apple-darwin9-gcc-4.0.1 --macosxtarget=10.4 --macosxsdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk

How to build for Nintendo Wii
=============================

For a Wii build you need:

- devkitPro:
    devkitPPC r16
    libogc 1.7.1
    libfat-ogc 1.0.4
- freetype cross-compiled for PPC.

For your convenience there is a script that will download/build all
you need.  To run it just type:

$ support/setupwii

Do this directly from the showtime root directory. This will download,
unpack, build and install all that's needed into a wiisupport/
directory. By default configure.wii will look into these directories
for devkitPro and freetype, so all you have to do now is:

$ ./configure.wii

$ make

If you have wiiload (http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiload) installed and
homebrew channel is running on your wii, you can just type:

$ make run

To start showtime on your wii.

If you have devkitpro and/or freetype someplace else, you can set
the path to them in configure.wii (see ./configure.wii --help for details)

Note: devkitPPC comes with a few bugs which is fixed by the support/setupwii
script. If you compile devkitPPC yourself you might need to fixup these
small issues. Please see the script for details.
