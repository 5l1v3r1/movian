How to build for Linux
======================

First you need to configure:

$ ./configure

If any dependencies are missing the configure script will complain.
You then have the option to disable that particular module/subsystem.

$ make

Build the binary, after build the binary resides in 'build.linux/'.
Thus, to start it, just type:

$ build.linux/showtime


How to build for Mac OS X
=========================

Install Xcode (http://developer.apple.com/Tools/) which includes Xcode IDE,
gcc toolchain and much more. iPhone SDK also includes Xcode and toolchain.

Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)

Install pkg-config using MacPorts
$ sudo port install pkgconfig

Now there are two possible ways to get a build environment, the MacPorts way
or the custome build scripts way. If you dont plan to build for different
architectures or SDKs as you are current running, or dont plan to compile with
fancy extensions, i would recommend the MacPorts way.

If you choose the custome script way, please continue to read osx/README

MacPorts way:

Install freetype using MacPorts:
$ sudo /opt/local/bin/port install freetype 

Now run configure
$ ./configure
Or if you build for release
$ ./configure --release

If configured successfully
$ make

Run showtime binary from build directory
$ build.osx/Showtime.app/Contents/MacOS/showtime

Run showtime application from build directory
$ open build.osx/Showtime.app

Optionally you can build Showtime.dmg disk image. Note that you should probably
run configure with --release to embed theme files or else the binary will
include paths your local build tree.
$ make Showtime.dmg

For more information read osx/README

TODO: universal binary, cant be done i one step as ffmpeg does not
build when using multiple arch arguments to gcc

How to build for Nintendo Wii
=============================

For a Wii build you need:

- devkitPro:
    devkitPPC r18
    libogc 1.8.1
    libfat-ogc 1.0.5
- freetype cross-compiled for PPC.

For your convenience there is a script that will download/build all
you need.  To run it just type:

$ support/setupwii

Do this directly from the showtime root directory. This will download,
unpack, build and install all that's needed into a wiisupport/
directory. By default configure.wii will look into these directories
for devkitPro and freetype, so all you have to do now is:

$ ./configure.wii
$ make

If you have devkitpro and/or freetype someplace else, you can set
the path to them in configure.wii (see ./configure.wii --help for details)

Note: libogc defaults to maximum of 16 threads.
This is on the edge for showtime. Therefore, the wiisetup script will
install a new version of lwp_config.h (see support/lwp_config.h) before
compiling libogc. If you intend to use a stock libogc you need to be aware
of this fact.


Wiiload
=======
If you have wiiload (http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiiload) installed and
homebrew channel is running on your wii, you can just type:

$ make run

To start showtime on your wii.

Homebrew package
================
The makefile system can build a homebrew package. To do this, type:

$ make homebrew

The output will reside in "build.wii/bundle/". Both a app directory
and a Zip file is generated.
