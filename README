How to build for Linux
======================

First you need to configure:

$ ./configure

If any dependencies are missing the configure script will complain.
You then have the option to disable that particular module/subsystem.

$ make

Build the binary, after build the binary resides in 'build.linux/'.
Thus, to start it, just type:

$ build.linux/showtime


How to build for OSX
====================

Install Xcode (http://developer.apple.com/Tools/) which includes Xcode IDE,
gcc toolchain and much more.

Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org)

Install freetype via MacPorts:

$ sudo /opt/local/bin/port install freetype

Now run configure

$ ./configure

If configured sucessfully, build the binary

$ make

Run showtime

$ build.darwin/Showtime.app/Contents/MacOS/showtime

Or

$ open build.darwin/Showtime.app

Optionally you can build Showtime.dmg disk image. Note that you should probably
run configure with --release to embed theme files or else the binary will
include paths your build tree.

$ make Showtime.dmg
