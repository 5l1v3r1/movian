These instructions will guide you how to get a complete build environment
for showtime

Create a new directory with the name of your choice, then donwload and
extract packages for these projects into it:

freetype, http://www.freetype.org
OpenSSL, http://www.openssl.org

Now copy the buildenv* scripts to the new directory:

There are several script for building build envionments, the support 
buildenv.10.4-i386.sh:
gcc 4.0, 10.4 SDK, compiles for i386 
Recommended

buildenv.10.6-i386-x86_64.sh:
Latest gcc (4.2 on 10.6), 10.6 SDK, compiles for i386 and x86 64
Have not been tested for a while

buildenv.10.4-i386-ppc.sh:
gcc 4.0, 10.4 SDK, compiles for PPC and i386 
Have not been tested for a while

buildenv.common.sh is a common help script used by all build scripts

After you have copied the files you may want to change the
INSTALLDIR variable in the build scripts

When done run:
$ sh buildenv.10.4-i386.sh

Now you can compile showtime using

./configure --cc="gcc-4.0 -arch i386" --macosx-sdk=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk --pkg-config-dir=$HOME/install-10.4-i386/lib/pkgconfig --enable-ssl
