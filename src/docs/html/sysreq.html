The video renderer in Showtime requires the following OpenGL extensions
to be supported by your graphics card:
<p>

<dl>
 <dt>GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object
 <dd>Needed for fast texture transfers from CPU.

 <dt>GL_ARB_fragment_program
 <dd>Used for converting from video native format to RGB.

 <dt>GL_ARB_texture_non_power_of_two
 <dd>Needed because no video format use resolution that is power of two.
</dl>
<p>
Showtime will not alert you if these extensions are missing during startup.
The video display will just not work. This is supposed to be fixed in
future releases.
<p>
Mini FAQ:
<dl>
 <dt>How do I check if my graphics card support these extensions?
 <dd>
 Use the 'glxinfo' command from a command prompt. It will list all the
 extensions supported by the GPU.

 <dt>Do you know which graphics cards that support these extensions?
 <dd>
 Any nVidia based graphics card equal to, or later than GeForce 6xxx
 should do the job. Showtime has been tested on GeForce 6xxx, 7xxx and 8xxx
 cards. Any decent ATI card should work as well. It has not been throughly
 tested though. If you have an ATI card, please report the outcome in the
 <a href="%%_HTSFORUM_%%">forum</a>.

 <dt>Will these constraints be relaxed in the future?
 <dd>
 Allthough it would make sense to add support for older GPUs the technology
 runs fast. Soon there wont be that many GPUs that does accelerated OpenGL
 without these extensions. It would be higher up on the TODO list to make
 a version of Showtime that does not rely on OpenGL at all.
